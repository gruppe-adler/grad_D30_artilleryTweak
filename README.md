This little mod is a balancing tweak for the [Shoot and Scoot](https://github.com/gruppe-adler/Shoot_and_Scoot.Tanoa) game mode.

The D30 towed artillery (shown in the picture below) has been criticized by players for its **severe inaccuracy**.

This mod 
* increases the accuracy 
* reduces the reload time between firing 2x shells
* replaces displayed names of artillery charges with less confusing ones
  * (that are also consistent with the ACE artillery range table)
